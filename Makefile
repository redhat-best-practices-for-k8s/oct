# There are four main groups of operations provided by this Makefile: build,
# clean, run and tasks.

# Build operations will create artefacts from code. This includes things such as
# binaries, mock files, or catalogs of CNF tests.

# Clean operations remove the results of the build tasks, or other files not
# considered permanent.

# Run operations provide shortcuts to execute built binaries in common
# configurations or with default options. They are part convenience and part
# documentation.

# Tasks provide shortcuts to common operations that occur frequently during
# development. This includes running configured linters and executing unit tests
